# Memory-Game
Project 2 Front End Nanodegree

This game operates by breaking the steps down into individual functions to fire off as the code goes on.
The code has comments through out to identify what each function is responsible for. Its starts by dynamically
creating the deck then adding event listeners.  As the code moves along various rules are applied to add
functionality to each of the requirements in the rubric.  When the game is completed a modal will appear to
alert the player the game has finished and allow for replays.
